# Email Attachment Malware Analysis System

A production-ready cybersecurity project for analyzing email attachments using a multi-engine approach.

## Features

- **Multi-Engine Scanning**:
  - **ClamAV**: Signature-based antivirus detection.
  - **YARA**: Pattern-based detection for suspicious code blocks.
  - **Heuristics**: Behavioral and structural analysis (extensions, file types, keywords).
- **Security Validation**: MIME type detection via magic bytes and strict size limits.
- **Modern UI**: Light-themed professional interface built with HTML/CSS.
- **Containerized**: Fully orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11)
- **Security**: ClamAV, YARA, python-magic
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Nginx

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose installed.

2. **Launch the System**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   *Note: On the first run, the `clamav` container will download virus signatures. This may take 2-5 minutes depending on your internet speed.*

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open `http://localhost` in your web browser.

4. **Testing Detection**:
   - You can test the detection functionality with the **EICAR test string**.
   - Create a file `test.txt` with:
     `X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*`
   - Upload it and verify the **Malicious** verdict.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI application and scanning core.
- `frontend/`: Static assets (HTML, CSS, JS).
- `yara_rules/`: Directory for custom detection patterns.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Services orchestration.

## Security Note

This tool is for analysis in controlled environments. Ensure the host system is isolated if you are analyzing real-world malware samples.
