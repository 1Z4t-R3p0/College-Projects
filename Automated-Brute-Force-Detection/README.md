# Automated Brute Force Attack Detection and Prevention System using Hydra

A complete final year project demonstrating how brute force attacks occur and how modern web applications detect and mitigate them.

## Overview

This project implements a vulnerable login application built with Python (Flask) along with a robust detection and prevention system. It automatically identifies brute-force attacks based on IP activity, rates limit excessive requests, and completely blocks malicious actors from accessing the application for a set period.

## How It Works

### 1. The Attack (How Brute Force Works)
A brute force attack is a trial-and-error method used by attackers to obtain credentials like passwords. Automated tools like Hydra systematically check all possible passwords until the correct one is found.

**How Hydra works:**
Hydra performs rapid dictionary attacks against various protocols (including HTTP POST forms). It uses a wordlist (`wordlist.txt`) and attempts logins at high speeds.

### 2. Detection Logic
The system monitors login attempts per IP address using Redis as a high-speed data store.
- Every failed attempt increments a counter for that IP.
- The system logs all activity (IP, Timestamp, Username) to `logs/attack.log`.

### 3. Prevention Logic
The application employs two layers of defense:
- **Rate Limiting:** If an IP makes more than 10 requests within 1 minute, the application returns `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`.
- **IP Blocking (Fail2Ban-like):** If an IP accumulates 5 failed login attempts, it is added to a temporary blocklist in Redis.
- **Access Denial:** Blocked IPs are completely denied access to the application (`HTTP 403 Forbidden`) displaying a warning message: *"Your IP has been temporarily blocked due to suspicious activity."*
- **Auto-Unblock:** The block automatically expires after 10 minutes.

## Setup & Running

This project uses Docker for seamless deployment without manual dependency installation.

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Hydra (for running the attack simulation)

### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)
Run this command from an elevated PowerShell command prompt:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Z4t-R3p0/College-Projects/main/Automated-Brute-Force-Detection/win-setup.ps1 | iex
```

### 🐧 WSL / Linux
Run this command from your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1Z4t-R3p0/College-Projects/main/Automated-Brute-Force-Detection/linux-setup.sh | bash
```

### Manual Local Setup (Docker)
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1Z4t-R3p0/College-Projects.git
cd College-Projects/Automated-Brute-Force-Detection
```
Run with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
Access the app at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running the Attack Simulation

The attack script uses `hydra` to simulate a brute force attempt.

1. Ensure the application is running.
2. Execute the attack script:
   ```bash
   ./attack.sh http://localhost:8080
   ```
   *(Or just `./attack.sh` to use the default localhost URL)*
3. Observe the output. Hydra will eventually be blocked, and the application will return status `403` or `429`.
4. Try accessing `http://localhost:8080` from your browser to see the block screen.

### Viewing Logs

To see the attack logs generated by the system:
```bash
cat logs/attack.log
```
Or check real-time container logs:
```bash
docker compose logs -f web
```
